# PCS2-homework-4
This folder contains my solutions to bioinformatics problems on the ROSALIND website. solutions in Python.

ROSALIND Website: http://www.rosalind.info/
In each folder (with the exception of "Python Village"), each problem has its own folder, named as follows:

## - ABCD - ???
## = How many I solved (e.g. 10 would mean that this is my 10th problem solved)
ABCD = ROSALIND's problem ID (each problem on ROSALIND has a unique 3-4 character ID)
??? = Official name of the problem
Each problem's folder contains 2 files:

.py file (the problem's solution)
README.jpg (the ROSALIND instructions for the problem)
